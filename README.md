# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy in real time. It generates random sentences for users to type and evaluates their performance based on speed (WPM), accuracy, and mistakes.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time typing speed test
- Calculates Words Per Minute (WPM)
- Tracks number of mistakes
- Provides accuracy percentage and motivational feedback
- Simple, clean interface
